# How to Use Safe3 SQL Injector v9 Full Version to Hack Web Applications
 
SQL injection is one of the most common and dangerous attacks against web applications. It allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database, and potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data. SQL injection can also lead to remote code execution, privilege escalation, or denial-of-service attacks.

There are many tools available to automate the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities, but one of the most powerful and easy-to-use ones is Safe3 SQL Injector v9 Full Version. This tool can automatically scan a web application for SQL injection flaws, identify the type and version of the database server, and perform various attacks to take over the database. It also has a built-in AI detection engine that can bypass some common security mechanisms.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use Safe3 SQL Injector v9 Full Version to hack a vulnerable web application. We will assume that you have already downloaded and installed the tool from its official website[^8^]. We will also assume that you have a target URL that is vulnerable to SQL injection, such as:

    https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts

This URL displays products in different categories based on the user input. However, it does not properly sanitize the input, and therefore allows SQL injection.
 
## Step 1: Launch Safe3 SQL Injector v9 Full Version
 
Open Safe3 SQL Injector v9 Full Version from your desktop or start menu. You will see a simple interface with a few tabs and buttons. The first tab is "Scan", where you can enter your target URL and start scanning for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Step 2: Enter your target URL and start scanning
 
In the "Scan" tab, enter your target URL in the "URL" field. You can also specify other options, such as cookies, headers, proxies, or user agents, if needed. Then click on the "Start" button to begin scanning.
 
The tool will send various requests to the target URL with different payloads, and analyze the responses for any signs of SQL injection. It will also try to identify the type and version of the database server behind the web application. You can see the progress and results of the scan in the lower panel.
 
## Step 3: Check the scan results and select an injection point
 
When the scan is finished, you will see a list of injection points found by the tool. Each injection point has a color-coded icon indicating its severity and type. For example, a red icon means a high-risk injection point that can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.
 
Select an injection point from the list by clicking on it. The tool will automatically switch to the "Exploit" tab, where you can perform various attacks using the selected injection point.
 
## Step 4: Perform various attacks using the selected injection point
 
In the "Exploit" tab, you can see more details about the selected injection point, such as its location, payload, database type, and version. You can also see a list of available attacks on the left panel, such as:
 
- Data: This allows you to view or modify data from any table or column in the database.
- File: This allows you to upload or download files from or to the database server.
- Shell: This allows you to execute system commands on the database server.
- Dump: This allows you to dump all data from a specific table or database.
- Blind: This allows you to perform blind SQL injection attacks using time delays or DNS queries.
- XSS: This allows you to inject cross-site scripting (XSS) payloads into vulnerable web pages.

Select an attack from the list by clicking on it. The tool will display a sub-panel with more options and buttons related to that attack. For example, if you select "Data", you will see a tree view of all databases,
